## Introduction

The Reference section provides in-depth information and documentation about the Kyber Network protocol, smart contracts and rest APIs. Details of each smart contract are well documented and can be found in their respective sections. If you wish to learn more about the specifications of our smart contracts, please refer to this [section](api-overview-smartcontract.md). The RESTful APIs give users (without understanding of smart contracts) the ability to interact with our smart contract functions. More details about our RESTful API can be found [here](api-overview-rest.md).
